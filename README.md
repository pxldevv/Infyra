# Infyra âœ¨ðŸš€

Infyra is a selfbot built with Discord.js v13, offering various features like avatar fetching and ping commands. Itâ€™s designed with a modular command and event handler system for easy expansion.

## Features

- **Command Handling**: Easily add and manage new commands in the `commands/` directory.
- **Alias Support**: Commands can have multiple aliases for flexibility.
- **User Avatar Fetching**: The `avatar` command can retrieve the avatar of a user, either by providing their ID or using the message author's own avatar.
- **Ping Command**: The `ping` command returns a "Pong!" reply, useful for checking if the bot is operational.
- **Configurable Prefix**: Customize the command prefix in `config.json`.
- **Allowed Users**: Only specific users (listed in `allowed.json`) are allowed to use the bot commands.
